<ul>
  <li>Sourced stock price data from various global financial institutions over a 2 year period.</li>
  <li>Performed time series analysis on data to produce daily, weekly and monthly stock price predictions.</li>
  <li>Created investment strategies that made buy, sell and hold recommendations in response to market conditions using bollinger bands.</li>
  <li>Resulting models yielded profits up to 20% of initial investment and registered no losses when used on test data.</li>
  <li>Employed time-series processing techniques including ARIMA modelling, simple exponential smoothing, LSTMs, facebook prophet and rolling forecasts among others.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="image-recognition-for-document-digitization"><a href="https://github.com/Daolaiya/iTgTyUmUQ7igs7pM">Image Recognition for Document Digitization</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Daolaiya/vmzcTtY32ejVJbYS"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub" alt="View on GitHub" /></a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Developed image prediction models to be used in tandem with software for manual, page-by-page digitization or scanning.</li>
  <li>Trained models to determine the endpoints between a page being fully displayed and a page that is being flipped to aid in accurate, legible scanning of book pages.</li>
  <li>Resulting models showed more than 90% accuracy with test data.</li>
  <li>Employed deep-learning image classification frameworks including ResNet and MobileNet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ranking-of-potential-candidates-using-job-postings"><a href="https://github.com/Daolaiya/l4Xr09Wq1DFkXsRQ">Ranking of Potential Candidates using Job Postings</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Designed NLP models that take a hiring company’s job posting, analyze the job titles and job descriptions of potential candidates, then rank all candidates based on their similarity to the given job description.</li>
  <li>Created a web interface that allows the user/operator to select their preferred candidates then updates the model’s ranking of all viable candidates in real time based on the new information.</li>
  <li>Employed NLP techniques such as word embedding, sentence transformation, vectorization, variable encoding and cross validation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Designed models to determine the  likelihood of a customer investing in a bond/term deposit using the financial and demographic data of a banking institution.</li>
  <li>Resulting models yielded up to 88% accuracy in predicting likelihood of investment.</li>
  <li>Resulting models also highlighted the demographic/customer segment to target for future investment with regards to age, profession, marital status, bank balance, mortgage status and debt status.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="customer-satisfaction-prediction-using-survey-data"><a href="https://github.com/Daolaiya/mountain-resort-pricing-strategy">Customer Satisfaction Prediction using Survey Data</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Daolaiya/vmzcTtY32ejVJbYS"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub" alt="View on GitHub" /></a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sourced data from the customer surveys of a Logistics and Delivery business including timeliness of delivery, pricing, courier performance, ease of app use, missing contents and overall satisfaction among others.</li>
  <li>Designed prediction models that evaluated and predicted customer satisfaction (satisfied or unsatisfied) using the survey data.</li>
  <li>Resulting models yielded accuracy up to ~80% when tested and identified the key components of the business operations which were responsible for maximizing customer satisfaction and minimizing customer turnover/churn.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ticket-price-analysis-for-ski-resorts"><a href="https://github.com/Daolaiya/mountain-resort-pricing-strategy">Ticket Price Analysis for Ski Resorts</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Daolaiya/vmzcTtY32ejVJbYS"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub" alt="View on GitHub" /></a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sourced data from 330 ski resorts in the United States including ticket prices, skiable area, annual days of operation, location, mountain elevations, number of chairlifts/trams and  snowfall among others.</li>
  <li>Designed prediction models that assessed the relationship between ticket prices (weekend, weekday, adult, child) and the different features, attractions and facilities available at the resorts.</li>
  <li>Resulting models yielded insights into how the client could raise its profit margin by up to 21% through eliminating redundant costs, changing ticket pricing strategy and adding new cost-effective facilities to its resort.</li>
